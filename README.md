# MIPS 16-bit Architecture Implementation in Verilog

## Overview
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a simplified 16-bit MIPS architecture processor. The design follows a single-cycle datapath and includes basic MIPS instructions.

## Features
- 16-bit instruction and data width
- Single-cycle datapath implementation
- Basic instruction set including:
  - R-type arithmetic/logic instructions
  - I-type immediate operations
  - Memory load/store
  - Branches and jumps
